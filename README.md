Multimodal Interactive Video Analysis
In the era of digital learning, the demand for effective tools that leverage multimedia content continues to rise. This project addresses this demand by proposing a novel approach to multimodal interactive video analysis aimed at enhancing learning and understanding. The primary objective is to develop a system that analyzes both video and audio data from videos and employs a question-and-answering (Q&A) framework to facilitate learning and understanding. Unlike traditional approaches to video analysis, which often rely on analyzing video content at the level of frames, our approach introduces a unique method: captioning every single frame. This granular approach allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the video content, capturing details and nuances that may be missed by traditional methods. By providing captions for each frame, our system aims to improve the accessibility and comprehension of educational videos, making learning more engaging and effective.

Through experimentation and evaluation, our project has revealed significant insights. One major finding is that traditional video analysis methods, which typically generate captions for groups of frames equal to the video's frames per second (fps), may overlook certain activities recorded in the video. In response to this limitation, our novel approach focuses on captioning every single frame, ensuring that no detail goes unnoticed. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of video analysis, particularly in educational contexts, by offering a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of video content. Overall, our project contributes to the advancement of multimedia-based learning tools, offering educators and learners alike a powerful platform for accessing and comprehending educational videos in a more interactive and engaging manner.
